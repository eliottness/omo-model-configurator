# Artificial Analysis Leaderboard Scraper

A Python web scraper designed to extract leaderboard data from the [Artificial Analysis website](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/providers/prompt-options/single/medium_coding?deprecation=all) and save it to a CSV file.

## Features
 
- Extracts leaderboard data from Artificial Analysis website, including dynamic content rendered by JavaScript using Playwright
- Handles fetching HTML content with retry mechanism and exponential backoff, and user-agent rotation
- Parses HTML content using Beautiful Soup 4, including dynamic identification and extraction of table headers
- Outputs data to CSV format with proper error handling and data validation using Pandera
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Configurable through YAML configuration file with environment variable overrides

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deyil/artificial-analysis-leaderboards-scraper.git
   cd artificial-analysis-leaderboards-scraper
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install the Playwright browser used by the scraper:
   ```bash
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

5. Install test dependencies when working locally:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the scraper with:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

If Playwright reports that the browser executable is missing, install it with:
```bash
python -m playwright install chromium
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
pytest -q
```

The scraper will:
1. Load configuration from `config.yaml`
2. Fetch HTML content from the target URL
3. Parse the leaderboard data from the HTML
4. Write the data to a CSV file

## Configuration

The scraper can be configured through the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
target_url: "https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/providers/prompt-options/single/medium_coding?deprecation=all"
output_csv_path: "data/leaderboard.csv"
output_add_timestamp: true
output_localize_numbers: true
output_locale: "el_GR"
```

- `target_url`: The URL of the leaderboard to scrape
- `output_csv_path`: The path where the CSV output will be saved
- `output_add_timestamp`: When `true`, appends `_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS` to the filename; set it to `false` to write the exact path, such as `data/leaderboard.csv`
- `output_localize_numbers`: When `true` (default), decimal-looking numeric values (e.g. `85.5`, `$11.25`) are formatted using the configured locale before writing to CSV. Set to `false` to write scraped values as-is. Can be overridden with the `OUTPUT_LOCALIZE_NUMBERS` environment variable.
- `output_locale`: The Babel locale string used to format decimal values (default: `"el_GR"` for Greek). Can be overridden with the `OUTPUT_LOCALE` environment variable.

## Components
 
### Scraper (`src/components/scraper.py`)
Handles fetching HTML content from the target website, specifically designed for dynamic content:
- Fetches HTML content from the leaderboard URL using Playwright for JavaScript rendering
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff and user-agent rotation
- Handles HTTP errors and timeouts
- Provides real-time feedback with a terminal spinner during Playwright execution
 
### Parser (`src/components/parser.py`)
Parses HTML content and extracts structured data:
- Uses Beautiful Soup 4 for HTML parsing
- Identifies and extracts table headers dynamically, including from complex table structures
- Extracts data from table rows, including provider names from image alt text or filenames
 
### Formatter (`src/components/formatter.py`)
Formats extracted data and outputs to CSV:
- Writes data to CSV files with proper error handling
- Validates data integrity using Pandera schemas
- Appends timestamp to output filenames in format _YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS unless `output_add_timestamp` is disabled
- Optionally localizes decimal-looking numeric values (e.g. `85.5` → `85,5`) using Babel with a configurable locale

## GitHub Actions

This repository includes a manual workflow at `.github/workflows/run-scraper.yml`.

Trigger it from the Actions tab with `Run workflow` to:
- install the scraper dependencies and Playwright browser
- run the scraper in GitHub Actions
- upload `data/leaderboard.csv` as a workflow artifact for download from the run summary
 
### Config (`src/components/config.py`)
Manages application configuration:
- Loads configuration from YAML file
- Provides default values and supports environment variable overrides
- Validates configuration parameters
 
### Logger (`src/components/logger.py`)
Configures and manages application logging:
- Outputs to both console (DEBUG level) and file (INFO level)
- Uses standard logging format: `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`

## Logging

The scraper uses structured logging with multiple levels:
- Console output: DEBUG level
- File output (`logs/scraper.log`): INFO level

Log format: `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`

## Error Handling

The scraper implements comprehensive error handling:
- Network errors: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Parsing errors: Graceful handling of malformed data
- File I/O errors: Proper error reporting and handling

## Terminal Spinner Feature

A terminal spinner has been added to provide real-time feedback during the Playwright rendering process. This feature uses the `rich` library to display a spinner in the terminal, indicating that the scraping process is in progress.

The spinner displays the following status messages during execution:
- "Rendering page with Playwright..."
- "Launching browser..."
- "Navigating to page..."
- "Waiting for page to load..."
- "Clicking headers..." (when header buttons are present)
- "Extracting HTML..."

## Dependencies

- beautifulsoup4: HTML parsing library
- pyyaml: YAML parser and emitter for Python
- playwright: For rendering JavaScript-heavy pages
- pandera: For data validation
- pandas: For data manipulation
- rich: For displaying the terminal spinner
- Babel: For locale-aware formatting of decimal numeric values

## Note
The reason for creating this scraper is that viewing and sorting tables directly on the Artificial Analysis website is not efficient. By exporting the data to a CSV file, users can easily sort and filter the scraped table data using their preferred spreadsheet application or data analysis tools.
